# Activity Emergency Vehicle Management System Complete

## Overview
This project implements an emergency vehicle management system using queue data structures in C. The system allows for the management of emergency vehicles by organizing them into normal and priority queues based on their urgency.

## Features
- **Normal Queue:** Handles standard emergency vehicle requests.
- **Priority Queue:** Manages high-priority emergency requests for quicker dispatch.
- **Dispatch System:** Efficiently dispatches vehicles based on their priority.

## Functionality
1. **Enqueue in Normal Queue:** Add a vehicle request to the normal queue.
2. **Enqueue in Priority Queue:** Add a vehicle request to the priority queue.
3. **Dispatch Vehicle:** Retrieve and remove the highest-priority vehicle from the queue for dispatch.

## Usage
1. Compile the program using a C compiler.
2. Run the executable.
3. Follow the on-screen menu to manage vehicle requests.

## Code Structure
- **Queue.h:** Contains the definitions and function prototypes for queue operations.
- **main.c:** Main program implementation for managing emergency vehicle requests.

## Prerequisites
- C Compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Basic knowledge of C programming and data structures
